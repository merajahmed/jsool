# MISSION #
Deliver a Java-like library for developers to create rich client side applications with high performance.

# The 3 Basic rules of JSOOL #
### 1. Be lazy and light ###

It's quite simple: Less code you write, faster it runs.

More code = more to download, execute and mantain

### 2. Is it fast? Let's do it faster ###

Throw the first stone who does not like to work with a fast and responsive software!

You have to write less code, according to the first rule, and this code must be fast, optimized, THE BEST!

### 3. Is there new stuff? Ok, let's use it ###

It's always quite nice to work with new technology and we have much stuff to work on like Canvas, Storage, Videos, SVG...
