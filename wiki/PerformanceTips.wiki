_NOTE:_ Most of these performance tips are not so significant individually but on a large scale, it can make some difference.

Good Luck!

== For Loops ==

*Case 1:* Simple index loop;
{{{
    var arr = new Array(10000);
    for(var i = arr.length-1; i--;){
        //... do cool stuff with array items
    }
}}}
Using a new variable to store the array length, makes no diference to performance.

*Case 2:* Loop and reference current item into a variable:
{{{
    var array = new Array(10000);
    for( var i = 0, item; item = array[i++];){
        //... do stuff with "item"
    }
}}}
This case is faster if you want a reference of the current item but dont have to change its value on array

== Mathematical Operations ==
*Tip:*

Operators like -=, +=, /=, `*`= ... are faster than reading the variable and "operating" it:
{{{
var a = 0;
//Slower
for(var i = 10000;i--;){
    a = a + i;
}



//Faster
for(var j = 10000;j--;){
    a += j;
}
}}}
